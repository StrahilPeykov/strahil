              A junior developer recently asked me: "Why would I learn how quicksort works when 
              GitHub Copilot can write it for me?" This question encapsulates a growing problem 
              in our industry.

        We're witnessing an unprecedented shift in how people learn to code. AI assistants like 
        GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and Claude have become indispensable tools for many developers. 
        But there's a dark side to this convenience that we need to talk about.

        The Dependency Trap
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        I've been coding for over a decade, and I've seen the landscape change dramatically. 
        When I started, Stack Overflow was the go-to resource. You'd search for a problem, 
        find similar issues, understand the solutions, and adapt them to your needs. The key 
        word here is <strong className="text-white">understand</strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Today, I watch junior developers type a comment like <code className="bg-slate-800 px-2 py-1 rounded">
        // function to validate email</code> and wait for Copilot to autocomplete the entire 
        implementation. They test it, it works, and they move on. But ask them to explain the 
        regex pattern or why certain edge cases matter, and you're met with blank stares.
      </p>

  if (!a.createdAt || !b.createdAt) return 0;
  const dateA = new Date(a.createdAt);
  const dateB = new Date(b.createdAt);

        Why This Matters
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        You might think, "So what? If the code works, who cares how it was written?" Here's why 
        it matters:

            <strong className="text-white">Debugging Becomes Impossible:</strong> When something

            <strong className="text-white">Security Vulnerabilities:</strong> AI often suggests

        </li>

            <strong className="text-white">Innovation Stagnates:</strong> True innovation comes

            <p className="text-gray-300">
              AI tools are most useful to those who already understand programming deeply. They 
              accelerate experienced developers while potentially crippling beginners. It's like 
              giving a Formula 1 car to someone who never learned to drive.

        The Path Forward
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        We're at a critical juncture in software development. AI tools are here to stay, and 
        they'll only get more powerful. The question is: will we use them to augment our 
        abilities or replace them?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        For experienced developers, the message is clear: embrace these tools but maintain 
        your fundamentals. For beginners, the path is harder but more important: resist the 
        temptation to shortcut your learning. Build a strong foundation first, then add AI 
        to your toolkit.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The future belongs to developers who can leverage AI while maintaining deep technical 
        knowledge, those who can think critically, solve complex problems, and understand not 
        just <em>what</em> their code does, but <em>why</em> it works.
